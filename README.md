### Self-Supervised Deep Blind Video Super-Resolution
By [Haoran Bai](https://csbhr.github.io/) and [Jinshan Pan](https://jspan.github.io/)

## Abstract
Existing deep learning-based video super-resolution (SR) methods usually depend on the supervised learning approach, where the training data is usually generated by the blurring operation with known or predefined kernels (e.g., Bicubic kernel) followed by a decimation operation. However, this does not hold for real applications as the degradation process is complex and cannot be approximated by these idea cases well. Moreover, obtaining high-resolution (HR) videos and the corresponding low-resolution (LR) ones in real-world scenarios is difficult. To overcome these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning method to solve the blind video SR problem, which simultaneously estimates blur kernels and HR videos from the LR videos. As directly using LR videos as supervision usually leads to trivial solutions, we develop a simple and effective method to generate auxiliary paired data from original LR videos according to the image formation of video SR, so that the networks can be better constrained by the generated paired data for both blur kernel estimation and latent HR video restoration. In addition, we introduce an optical flow estimation module to exploit the information from adjacent frames for HR video restoration. Experiments show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art ones on benchmarks and real-world videos.
